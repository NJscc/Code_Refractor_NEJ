Homework repository for the homework assignment 'Code Refactor'.

The HTML and CSS pages, with associated files, create a
'Horiseon' webpage as shown in the image, with working hyperlinks
at the top-right of the webpage.

A list of code corrections (in no particular order):

-Webpage function corrections-

    - Fixed 'Search Engine Optimization' internal link.

    - Browser tab has an appropriate title.

-General code corrections-

    -Replaced 'div' elements with semantic tags.

    -Spaced out code to be more legible.

    -Broke text paragraphs into lines to make it
        easier to read.

    -Fixed 'Search Engine Optimization' link by adding ID
        in line 34.
    -Fixed browser tab by altering text in 'title' element.

    -Added descriptive comments to CSS file, and simplified
        it by grouping different classes with the same function
        into single classes and replacing old, unique classes
        in the HTML file with these new class names. (Namely, 
        '.focus' and '.benefit' classes.)
